# StatusIndicator
An addon for FireFall that shows the duration of active abilities, procced perks, status effects and calldowns.  This addon is outdated and I will be making updates to try and bring it online for version 1.6.  Initially adding a hard coded timer for the Heroism skill will be priority, followed by pulling the true duration from the API and setting the timer based on it.  Next I will attempt to include other new abilities and integration with ER duration gains and the revised perk system.  Feel free to get in touch or submit a PR if you have any thoughts or want to help.
